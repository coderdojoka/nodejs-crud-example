# Node.js CRUD Example

## Installation
Download the Node installer for your machine OS from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
To verify everything is set up correctly, run `node --version` in a Terminal. It should print the installed Node version number, for example `v10.14.1`.

This installation includes NPM (the Node Package Manager) which we will use to manage our dependencies.

## Running 
Run `npm start` or `node src/server.js` from the root directory to start the server on your local machine.
